# Why do we need Vite?

WebPack needs to build everything on every save. (Large application take serveral minutes to reload)

## Bundle-based development server setup

All possibilities are bundle together then our development server is ready to run

Webpack bundler will crawl all your JS modules before launching the dev server

Vite starts the server right the away. Vite take dependencies don't change often and pre-bundles them using **esbuild (writen in Go)**.

Vite uses route-based code splitting (doesnâ€™t have to rebundle everything)

Vite delivers native es modules supported in modern browsers. (Browser take the job of bundling and development)

For production vite uses **Roll Up to bundle and tree shake.**

 

When you start dev build, Vite will start by dividing your JS into two categories: **dependenciy modules and application modules**
